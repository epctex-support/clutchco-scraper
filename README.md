## Features
Clutch.co doesn't provide a very flexible or free API, but this scraper acts as an unofficial Clutch API to help you extract the data you need, when you need it, and at scale.

Clutch.co Scraper supports the following features:

-   **Search any keyword**

-   **Scrape lists**

-   **Scrape reviews**

-   **Scrape company profile**

Clutch provides a "platform of in-depth client reviews, data-driven content, and vetted market leaders". Scraping that content and extracting it in structured format could give you invaluable business insights and an edge over the competition.

## Input parameters

The input of this scraper should be JSON containing the list of pages on Clutch.co that should be visited. Required fields are:

| Field                | Type    | Description                                                                                                                                                                              |
| -------------------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| search               | String  | (optional) Keyword that you want to search on Clutch.co. This is required when `mode` is defined.                                                                                          |
| mode                 | String  | (optional) Mode that you want to use the search keyword on. The values can only be: `profiles` and `companies`. This is required when `search` field is defined.                           |
| includeReviews       | Boolean | (optional) Adding reviews into the profile objects is optional and by default it is `false`. If you want to scrape the reviews of the companies, then you can set this option as `true`. |
| maxItems             | Integer | (optional) You can limit scraped profiles. This should be useful when you search big lists.                                                                                  |
| startUrls            | Array   | (optional) List of Clutch.co URLs. You should only provide list or detail URLs.                                                                                                           |
| endPage              | Integer | (optional) Final number of page that you want to scrape. Default is `Infinite`.                                                                                                          |
| proxy                | Object  | Proxy configuration.                                                                                                                                                                      |
| extendOutputFunction | String  | (optional) Function that takes a JQuery handle ($) as argument and returns object with data.                                                                                              |
| customMapFunction    | String  | (optional) Function that takes company profile object as argument and returns object with the mapping function.                                                                           |

This solution **requires the use of proxy servers**, either your own proxy servers or [Apify Proxy](https://www.apify.com/docs/proxy).

### Tips

When you want to have a scrape over a specific listing URL, just copy and paste the link as one of the **startURL**.

If you would like to scrape only the first page of a list, then add the link for the page and have the `endPage` as 1.

Please also keep in mind that the `includeReviews` parameter will add multiple requests per company. That's why the number of requests or CUs that are consumed might be higher if you set this option as `true`.

## Compute unit consumption

Clutch.co Scraper is optimized to run extremely fast and scrape many as listings as possible, so it forefronts all listing detail requests. If the actor doesn't get blocked very often, it will scrape 100 listings in 2 minutes and consume ~0.07-0.08 compute units.

### Clutch.co Scraper input example

```json
{
    "startUrls": [
        "https://clutch.co/profile/smartsites",
        "https://clutch.co/web-developers/freelance",
        "https://clutch.co/profile/blue-collar-agency"
    ],
    "search": "api",
    "mode": "companies",
    "endPage": 1,
    "maxItems": 50,
    "includeReviews": false,
    "customMapFunction": "(object) => { return object }"
}
```

## During the run
During the run, the actor will output messages letting you know what is going on. Each message always contains a short label specifying which page from the provided list is currently specified.

When items are loaded from the page, you should see a message about this event with a loaded item count and total item count for each page.

If you provide incorrect input to the actor, it will immediately stop with a failure state and output an explanation of what is wrong.

## Clutch.co export
During the run, the actor stores results into a dataset. Each item is a separate item in the dataset.

You can manage the results in any languague (Python, PHP, Node.js/NPM). See the FAQ or <a href="https://www.apify.com/docs/api" target="blank">our API reference</a> to learn more about getting results from this Clutch.co actor.
